    <p class="lead">Hey! Doggodex was <b>wrong</b>!</p>
    <p>Well, its not always correct. Doggodex achieved around an 80% accuracy during training and was trained to 
        only classify 120 different breeds of dogs. There are approximately 300+ breeds of dogs according to online sources, and 
        Doggodex tries to give you a single result, so it will try its best to give you a definitive answer according to the model.
        The scenarios Doggodex struggles with are:
        <li>detecting a dog of mixed breeds</li>
        <li>dog breeds outside of the training dataset,</li>
        <li>images that contain a lot of visual noise</li>
        <li>images that do not contain a dog</li>
        <li>identifying the breed of a dog that shares a lot of visual similarties to other dog breeds</li>
        <br>
        ...and so on!
    </p>
