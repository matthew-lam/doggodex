    <p class="lead">Hey! Doggodex was <b>wrong</b>!</p>
    <p>Well, its not always correct. Doggodex achieved around an 80% accuracy during training and was trained to 
        only classify 120 different breeds of dogs. There are approximately 300+ breeds of dogs according to online sources, and 
        Doggodex tries to give you a single result, so it doesn't account for problems such as:
        <li>detecting a dog of mixed breeds</li>
        <li>dog breeds outside of the training dataset,</li>
        <li>images that contain a lot of visual noise or not of a dog</li>
        <li>identifying the exact breed of a dog, especially if it looks very similar to another breed</li>
        and so on.
    </p>
